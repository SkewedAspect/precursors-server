Plan:

top level:  chat system manager
	client login hook for auto joins
	root creation/destruction
mid level:  client command handler
	room lookup by pid as list,
	command interpretation/translation
low level:  rooms
	chat message propogation
	state of each chatter/controller
low level:  chatter
	fsm for chatter.  muted, controller.  little more than a library
	module for a data structure, though.
